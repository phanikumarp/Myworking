/**
 * This identifies which getter and setter methods you want exposed via JMX. This is added to methods that are in the
 * form {@code getXxx()}, {@code isXxx()}, or {@code setXxx()} for the {@code xxx} field. The {@code Xxx} should match
 * precisely to associate the get and set JMX features. For example, if you are getting and setting the {@code fooBar}
 * field then it should be {@code getFooBar()} and {@code setFooBar()}. {@code isFooBar()} is also allowed if
 * {@code foobar} is a boolean or Boolean field. Instead of annotating the methods, you can use the
 * {@link JmxAttributeField} to annotate the fields you want to expose.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Notice that although the field-name is {@code fooBar} with a lowercase 'f', the method name camel-cases it and turns
 * it into {@code getFooBar()} with a capital 'F'. This class is similar to Spring's &#64;ManagedAttribute. In addition,
 * the "getXxx()" method must not return void and must have no arguments. {@code isXxx()} is allowed if it returns
 * boolean or Boolean and the method has no arguments. The "setXxx()" method must return void and must take a single
 * argument -- the same argument as the getter returns.
 *
