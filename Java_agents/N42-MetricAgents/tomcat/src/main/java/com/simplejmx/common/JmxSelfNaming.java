/**
 * This allows objects to name themselves based on fields or values internal to the _instance_ of the class. This is
 * often used by objects that have multiple instances and that are dynamically added and removed. Examples of objects
 * that might use self-naming are: database connections, log instances, network config objects. Anytime you have
 * multiple instances of the same object that you want to expose via JMX.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You register these objects using the standard {@link JmxServer#register(Object)} methods and then call
 * {@link JmxServer#unregister(Object)} if they are removed later. For an example of dynamic self-naming objects, see
 * the JmxIntegrationTest class.
